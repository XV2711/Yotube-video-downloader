Intro to the project

This project centers on a lightweight web interface that allows users to input a YouTube URL and choose between video or audio output. The back end handles the heavy lifting: it runs yt-dlp to fetch metadata, download the desired format, and return a downloadable file to the user. The front end provides a simple, responsive interface that keeps the user informed about the progress and status of the operation.

The goals are straightforward:

- Provide a clean, dependable download experience without bloating the user interface.
- Keep dependencies minimal and easy to install.
- Make it simple to contribute and extend, whether you want to add new formats, add fresh front-end features, or improve the deployment process.
- Ensure the app can run on local machines for testing and on lightweight servers for small-scale usage.

Key features

- MP4 downloads: extract video content in a widely supported container and codec.
- MP3 downloads: audio extraction when available; this feature is on a coming-soon timeline.
- Simple URL input: paste a YouTube link and start the download with a click.
- Progress feedback: the UI shows status, progress bars, and estimated time, so users know what’s happening.
- Lightweight backend: a small Flask-based server that coordinates with yt-dlp to perform downloads.
- Frontend separation: HTML/CSS/JavaScript manage the user interface, while Python handles the backend tasks.

Under the hood

- Backend: Python with the Flask framework to route requests, a small controller to interface with yt-dlp, and a file-serving mechanism to return completed downloads to the client.
- Media tooling: yt-dlp is the core tool used to fetch and extract media from YouTube and other supported sites. It handles format selection and container conversion.
- Frontend: a simple HTML/CSS layout with JavaScript to handle user actions, display progress, and trigger background tasks via HTTP requests.
- Data flow: A user submits a URL → the frontend sends a request to the backend → the backend runs yt-dlp to fetch and convert → the server returns the file to the user.
- Error handling: the app provides user-friendly error messages for missing input, invalid URLs, and download failures, then logs errors for debugging.

Tech stack overview

- Python: core language for the backend logic and orchestration.
- Flask: light web framework to handle routing, requests, and responses.
- yt-dlp: primary media downloader and converter tool.
- HTML/CSS: structure and styling for the user interface.
- JavaScript: dynamic UI behavior, progress updates, and async interactions.
- FFmpeg (implicit in yt-dlp): for media conversion when needed.
- Open-source license and community-friendly setup.
